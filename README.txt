How to Use:
 - Either use this unzipped folder as a directory or 
   create a new one called UtPod and copy the contents of this over
 - Type "make" into the command line after moving to the directory with the files from the zip
 - Start the program with "./test"
 - The program will test all the functions and edge cases (i.e. removing a song from an
   empty UtPod or removing only 1 copy of a song when there are multiple in the list)
